      <p>Golden's are incredible swimmers. Their large webbing between the toes and long tail to aid in steering makes them water-based dogs.<br>
      Owning a golden retriever can cost you $13,000 over his lifetime considering he will live 10 years.<br>
      This breed has 2 layers of fur. The inner layer is to keep warm and the outer layer is waterproof.</p>
